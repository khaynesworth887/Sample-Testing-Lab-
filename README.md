# Sample-Testing-Lab-
CMIS202 Major Project Assignment

Who: This will be used by a sample testing laboratory.

What: The user will use this application to manage lab tests and to evaluate results. The application will have a database component to manage results generated by multiple test runs. 

Where: The software will be uploaded on lab and office computers to analyze the results and maintain a database. 

When: The software will manage and evaluate data after the raw data are generated by a laboratory instrument. In a single test run, eighteen samples are tested. A map structure will be used to match each result to a sample or patient ID number. Eventually a database will have a list of patients and samples ID numbers and the correspond results from different test runs for each patient, for example on different time intervals. 

Why: This application will be custom design to meet the needs of a specific lab. It will account for the type of tests the lab can run.
